JournAI is a journalling app that integrates with a natural language processing model to give you data on your emotions within journal entries. I worked on it in a group of four during the HackED 2023 hackathon. The main goal was to provide users a way of visualizing their emotions to allow for them to better introspect.

My contributions were on the backend side, where I helped set up the layout of our document store in Firebase Cloud Firestore, as well as with querying firestore. I also set up the dynamic routing to allow users to hop to a separate page to view specific journal entries.

This was my first (and hopefully last) experience doing web development. Suffice
it to say that it is not my cup of tea. I much prefer making a pile of metal move
autonomously!
