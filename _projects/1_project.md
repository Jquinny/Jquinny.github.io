Pythons on a Plane is an infinite sidescroller where enemies and obstacles get significantly faster over time. I worked on it in a group of four for the HackED 2022 hackathon. My contributions were mainly in game logic and obstacles/backgrounds. [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-iTU2XvVp8) is a demo video showing the game mechanics.

This was my first project outside of a classroom setting, meaning no perfectly
described problem statement and solution expectation. This was a good wake up call to what real world development looks like, and an experience that I will cherish for that reason.

Don't look at the code though, as I said, this was like my first real project and the spaghetti monster will likely visit you in your nightmares if you do
