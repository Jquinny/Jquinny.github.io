I'm a fourth year computer science student at the University of Alberta. I recently finished up a computer vision undergraduate research internship this past summer where I built a video processing algorithm that could detect and track 15 classes of vehicles. I learned many things about the data science lifecycle such as MLOps best practices and deep learning model training.

While in school I've learned many computer science topics such as operating systems, machine learning, database management, data structures and algorithms, and many math topics like calculus, linear algebra, and numerical methods. In my free time I'm exploring the world of machine learning for autonomous vehicles and robotics.

Outside of tech I like to spend my time reading Sci-Fi and Philosophy, gaming, being active out in nature, and practicing mixed martial arts.
