Currently, I am a computer science student at the University of Alberta, heading into my final semester of my bachelors degree. I've dipped my toes in many domains during my time in university, such as robotics, machine learning/AI, and computer graphics, and I am excited to solve some real impactful problems while expanding my horizons and mastering my craft :)

Outside of tech I like to spend my time in nature, either running, hiking, or just going for a walk and enjoying the fresh air. There is nothing quite like watching two grasshoppers battle it out on a lawn chair, or a squirrel doing parkour in the trees :smiley:. I also like to dabble in various other activities, such as martial arts, reading, playing video games, and watching anime.
