I'm a fifth year computer science student at the University of Alberta, heading into my final semester of my bachelors degree. I have taken a wide variety of math and CS courses during my degree that have broadened my vision of what is possible with code. This includes courses covering machine learning, computer graphics, robotics, operating systems, databases, theoretical and practical algorithms, and much more.

I've completed two internships during my time in university, my first being at a [robotics startup](https://promiserobotics.com/) where I got to build a computer vision system from scratch. This experience introduced me to a whole bunch of new concepts I had never previously encountered, such as client-server architectures, computer networking, multi-threaded programming, and of course writing computer vision algorithms using Python and OpenCV. My second internship was a research internship at the University of Alberta, where I got to dabble in more computer vision, but this time with more emphasis on deep learning and MLOps.

Currently, I am preparing myself for the work force by researching what companies are making positive impacts out in the world, and assessing what new skills I can develop to fit the niche's those companies require.

Outside of tech I like to spend my time in nature. There is nothing quite like watching two grasshoppers battle it out on a lawn chair, or a squirrel doing parkour in the trees :smiley:. I also like to dabble in various physical activities, like running, bjj, and dancing. On the nerdier side of the spectrum, I find myself reading Sci-Fi and Philosophy books, playing video games, and watching anime.
